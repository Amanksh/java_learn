âœ… Project Idea: College Course Management System

ðŸ§  Concept:

You are building a backend API to manage:

Students

Courses

Professors

Departments


Each of these entities will interact using various JPA relationships (One-to-Many, Many-to-One, Many-to-Many). Youâ€™ll also implement DTOs, ResponseEntity, and global exception handling for clean, production-grade APIs.
